#  Storm Sentinel üå™Ô∏èüõ°Ô∏è


## TLDR; Here is the demo! üöÄ
Coming soon...
## üìñ A little intro...
Fresh off of watching [Only the Brave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE_GY6zccqc), a movie illustrating an incredible true story about firefighters fighting the wildfires out west, I wanted to build something wildfire-themed. 

I was looking for a way to gain access to live information about currently occuring wildfires, and stumbled across NASA's satellite [data](https://api.nasa.gov/) üõ∞Ô∏è. As part of their EONET (Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker) api, NASA provides data not only on wildfires, but on all natural disasters currently occuring.

So I thought, why not? Let's use this to build a live natural disaster tracker for any type of disaster currently occuring. And voila - Storm Sentinel was born.
